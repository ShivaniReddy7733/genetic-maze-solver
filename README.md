# 🧬 Genetic Maze Solver

 I built this project to explore how a Genetic Algorithm can solve a maze by evolving a population of possible paths over time. It was a fun way to apply AI concepts like selection, crossover, and mutation to find the most efficient route from start to finish
 
## 🚀 Features

- Genetic Algorithm implementation in Python
- Maze navigation using fitness-based selection
- Visualizations using matplotlib
- Simple and customizable design

## 📁 Files

- Genetic_Algos_Maze_Solver.ipynb: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the code, logic, and visualizations

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Genetic algorithms
- Fitness functions
- Crossover & mutation
- Evolutionary selection
- Maze path optimization

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

Install dependencies using:

bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
